For Project 2, we were challenged with contectualizing a space. I chose the Michigan Theater in Ann Arbor and decided on the goal of creating a discussion platform for recent movies. My aim was to create a quick interface for people who had just seen a movie to be connected with others who had also seen the movie by deciding to skip or reply to discussion posts. The app then opens in Messages to open a fast conversation focusing on the movie.
